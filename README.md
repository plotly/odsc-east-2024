# ODSC East 2024: How to Build an Interactive Front End for Your Python Data Science Models

## About this workshop

In this workshop, you will learn how to build an interactive front end for your Python data science models. More specifically, this workshop cover the following:

* Introduction to the fundamentals of Plotly graphing libraries
* Defining an application layout
* Writing callback functions to make your application interactive
* Creating a front end to run a machine learning model in Dash
* Showing examples of Dash applications for different use cases

Downloading the files ahead of time isn't required, but may be helpful for following along.

## How to run these applications

To run these applications, clone the repository and then open a terminal to the app folder.

Create and activate a new virtual environment (recommended) by running
the following:

On Windows:

```
python -m venv myvenv
\myvenv\Scripts\activate.bat
# OR
\myvenv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

On Linux:

```bash
python3 -m venv myvenv
source myvenv/bin/activate
```

Install the requirements:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Run the app:

```
python <app_name>
```
You can run the app on your browser at http://127.0.0.1:8050
